# Crowdfunding Platform

## 📌 Project Description

A decentralized crowdfunding platform built using Solidity that allows individuals to raise funds transparently and securely. Contributors can fund projects, and funds are only transferred if the funding goal is met within the specified deadline. Otherwise, contributors can get a refund.

## 🌍 Project Vision

To empower creators to raise funds directly from the public without intermediaries, while ensuring that contributors’ funds are protected through on-chain smart contract logic.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🏗️ **Campaign Creation**: Automatically initialized with a funding goal and deadline.
- 💸 **Contribute**: Anyone can contribute Ether to the campaign before the deadline.
- ✅ **Goal Verification**: If the funding goal is met, the creator can withdraw the funds.
- 🔁 **Refund**: If the goal is not reached, contributors can withdraw their money.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- 🧾 Multiple campaign creation and listing support
- 🪙 ERC20 token contributions instead of ETH
- 📊 Real-time analytics dashboard with React & Ethers.js
- 🔐 Campaign verification and social proof (IPFS-backed identity)
- 📱 Mobile UI integration using WalletConnect
